# Introduction-to-Statistics-with-R
Teaching 2020 Fall

We will be using R, a free programming language, to conduct the statistical analyses in this course. Although we will have a workshop to help you start, you are responsible for securing the program and have it installed before the first workshop. Materials will be provided and demonstrated in class very briefly, so you need to practice more outside the class. 

Installing RStudio:
* https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Choose RStudio Destop free version. 
*	If your laptop is more than one year old, you may not be able to use the most up-to-date RStudio version. This is perfectly fine, and it will not affect your data analysis results. Please refer to this link https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/older-versions/ and make sure the downloaded RStudio version is compatible with your operating system.
* If you need more explanations, use this online book Chapter 3.1 “Installing R” to get you started https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/introR.html#gettingR

Installing R:
*	https://cran.r-project.org/ After installing RStudio, you need to have the R language installed. Download from this link.
*	The version of R also needs to be compatible with your operating system.
